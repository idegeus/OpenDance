# OpenDance
Idea for an Open Source dancing application for member management, video distribution, aggregation, video analysis and more. 

This idea formed from my personal huge library of moves in different dancing styles, which are kind of impossible to track for me. I've also done some volunteering work for dance schools, and it's quite difficult to schedule, manage cohorts, distribute video's, coordinate and rebalance absences and more. 

**Why Open Source?** I think most Dance Schools are very much watching the margins. There are existing software solutions that do this kinda stuff at a paid price, but their adoption is slow and I don't think much money is to be found in this area. I just want to have everything organised, also for the dance schools where I'd like to volunteer. 

Please star this repo, or feel free to contribute by making some edits or issues. I'm not sure when I want to work on this yet, but if we've assembled a crack team could be nice.
